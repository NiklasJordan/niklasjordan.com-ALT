<p class="lead">UX can help Non-Profits solve complex challenges to improving the world a little, or let's say, make it really better.</p>

## What is User Experience?
User Experience (UX) is made up of all the experiences and impressions a user has on your website - whether positive or negative.
The user experience directly affects how well or badly your page works for the user. Does he find what he is looking for? Does he have fun? Is he annoyed? Is it easy to donate something? All these experiences are also linked to your organisation.

### Good vs. bad UX
<p class="half">Good UX is something that often remains undetected. It gives the user a sense of simplicity and elegance when using the site. It exists behind the scenes - in small details, useful functions and supportive services.
But as soon as something does not work as expected, we are annoyed. This frustration remains in our memory. And: We link our anger with your organisation ...</p>

## What is a UX Review
<p class="half">In a User Experience Check, we evaluate the usability of your website or your online store regarding common usability principles and best practices.</p>

I will be looking for anything that stands out to us as being a problem with regard to the user experience, appearance, usability and accessibility.

### What do you get from me?

### For *free*? Are you drunk? :confused:
Of course **not**. Everyone should help with what he can do well. And my talent is to provide the best services and products for users. The talent of many organisations is to find solutions and master challenges that struggle for a better life, equality or more consideration for nature. Unfortunately, the digital platforms are not used optimally. To change that, I offer my help.

But, there are some ground rules:
<ul class="hug">
<li>You represent a real company</li>
<li>You are actively seeking a UX partner</li>
<li>This will be a single-cycle activity</li>
</ul>
