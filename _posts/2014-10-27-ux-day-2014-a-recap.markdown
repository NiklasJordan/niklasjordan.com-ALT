The alarm clock rang surprisingly late: 22:00 pm the day before the conference. The early bird catches the user.

Two hours by car, five hours by train, one hour of sleep and 2 croissants later I arrive in Frankfurt (Main). Now again change and 2 hours of Mannheim. Mannheim - here it is!

## Here we go

Already arrived barely started the keynote by [Thomas Fickert](http://thomas-fickert.com) on "Smart Digital Experiences for the Internet of Everything". All quiet on the western front, I think. But I was disabused. He explained why he thinks Apps abdicate in future and will instead be replaced by other contextual interactions. An example are notifications. That means I do not have to download a big app to get information about a product into a store. These interactions are called,micro experiences' and it will change our offline shopping experience significantly.

Note: Intercom has just published a very interesting article on this topic. [Here we go](http://blog.intercom.io/the-end-of-apps-as-we-know-them/).

## User friendly navigation on your phone

Enough in SciFi. Once I have the awesome location, the Alte Feuerwache Mannheim, looked at me a little closer, bring me back to the here and now. 
eResult has published a study in which it has set 13 probands from various online stores and websites. Task was to navigate through the site and find specified products. Reason for you study: 52% of users connect to the mobile browsing experience negative, 58% found the mobile sites usually confusing and 36% even user-unfriendly. More about the [case study here](http://www.eresult.de/ux-wissen/forschungsbeitraege/einzelansicht/news/mobile-web-navigation-navigieren-und-orientieren-auf-dem-smartphone/).

## Considering Consistency Consistently
A real highlight and my absolute favorite was the presentation by [Marcus Trapp](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marcus-trapp/6b/783/170). Marcus is researcher at the Fraunhofer Institute on the topics of human-computer interaction and usability. In his presentation, it was all about, to call the importance of consistency in applications and websites to the memory of each individual.

**What is consistency?**
The word consistency means that when I learned how to deal with a function, application or website, I have in the further use of an expectation. Namely, that the application still works the same as at the time, as I learned it. The best example is driving a car. We have learned that at some point on the far right the accelerator, in the middle of the brake and the clutch is on the left. If we sit today in a car, we no longer think about it, to which we give the gas pedal, because we have learned the operator, internalized and lead them now without cognitive effort. This allows us to put our thoughts on other things while driving, such as the traffic ;) I hope so.

Similarly, this also works with websites and apps. We have learned to operate and come the next time on the site with the expectation that we are familiar with and know exactly where we want to go, or how to get to the information they seek.

Much praise also goes to the organizers that they have even made ​​a sign language interpreter with the stage (and of course great for the organization). Unfortunately, i do not see often. Keep it up!
