Most designs go with the available defaults. Either using a format that doesn't have these issues or, more frequently, letting the details slip. The information still gets across and every web site has a punch list of potential modifications that stretches to the horizon. So, I understand putting off finding a solution, but not having proper date formatting has always bugged me. While solving the issue for myself5, I decided to put together this post as a public reference as well. I don't yet have the Ruby chops to contribute directly to Jekyll, but I can provide this reference to give back a little at least.
