Jeff Atwood, co-founder of [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/), is working on a new project: the platform [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/). A special challenge and priority for him was the login page. He asked himself how looks a login page, if God would make it. With other words: the perfect login page.

> And the answer is, of course, God wouldn’t bother to build a login dialog at all. Every user would already be logged into GodApp the second they loaded the page because God knows who they are. Authoritatively, even.

Here my summary of the article:

- Renounce username for the authentication process, instead use the e-mail address
- When requesting a new password, the user should be notified when the entered e-mail address does not exist
- The user should always be able to switch between the log-in and registration
- The wording on the buttons to Login or Register should be very different. 
Bad: Sign Up and Sign In 
Good: Register and Sign In
- Help the user to avoid mistakes. For example: issue a warning when Caps Lock is active
- The user to use a secure password Help
- Help the user to apply a secure password
- Limit incorrect log-in attempts
