# Me & what I do

![Portrait of Niklas Jordan](uploads/niklas-jordan.jpg)

By day I help *good* organizations <mark>create products and services people need (and love) that have a good impact on their mission and the world</mark>. I do this through smart research, experience and psychology.

By night I am a lot outside in nature, go climbing or engage me in the same way.

## Services I can help you with

### User Experience & Usability Engineering

    <div class="spalte abstand">
      <p class="half">As a UX guy I look at the whole context of an interaction, from what brought the user to your organization, to where they want to go once they are finished.</p>
      <p>Creating that complete experience is central to my work as a user experience architect. I design and moderate usability studies and conduct usability expert reviews to evaluate design problems.</p>
      <p>Short: I envision and design the experience for the user from start to finish of an interaction with a product or service.</p>

      <p class="half">Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is the act of making improvements to your website to increase your online leads, whether for increasing prospects or donation.</p>
      <p>The process of CRO is about subtly guiding users towards the goal. To do this, I will analyse where improvements can be made, test different tactics to find which works best, and implement the change for a higher conversion rate.</p>
