## Services I can help you with

### UX Research
UX research provides a window into your volunteers’ and donors’ world: from what they need to what makes them tick. Research takes the guesswork out of creating a great experience and give you the insight and evidence you need to make the right decisions.

UX research can help with all manner of  challenges and questions, such as:
- What interests our users?
- Why bounce users without a conversion (like a donation, newsletter subscription, etc.)
- How can we attract new donors?
- How can we convince users of our mission?
- How can we provide an excellent donation experience?
- We have an idea for a new service / new product or a new feature - how do we know if our users find it useful?
- Why is our conversion rate decreasing?

### UX Design
I use UX design to help untangle social challenges, develop much more effective tools and make the world a better place.

It's include:
- Workshops
- Research, Checks & Audits
- Wireframing & Prototyping
- Expert UX Reviews & Design Recommendations
- Usability Testing
