# About me


## My beliefs

*Do Good.* That's what I believe in! I believe in a <mark>digital world for everyone</mark>. Therefore I support Non-Profits for free.

### My standards

#### Human Rights
* Technology that respects human rights is zero-knowledge, free and open source, accessible, and sustainable.
* It respects and protects civil liberties, reduces inequality, and benefits democracy.

1. Technology that respects human rights is zero-knowledge, free and open source, accessible, and sustainable.
2. It respects and protects civil liberties, reduces inequality, and benefits democracy.
3. Technology that respects human effort is delightful: functional, convenient, and reliable.
4. It is thoughtful and accommodating; not arrogant or demanding. It understands that you might be distracted or differently-abled. It respects the limited time you have on this planet.
