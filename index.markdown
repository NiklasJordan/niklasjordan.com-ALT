# Ahoy!

<p class="lead">I am Niklas, a problem solver for NGOs, having a passion for good user experience and technology.</p>

I help *good* organizations <mark>create products and services that people need (and love), products that have a good impact on their mission and the world</mark>. I do this through smart research, experience, and psychology. 
I live in Schwerin, Northern Germany. It’s pretty nice here; I think you’d like it.

Check out the [services I offer](/who-i-am.html), to learn how I can help you to do good better.

**I’m in it for good:**  My focus is on delivering projects for organizations or companies that strive to do good work. Green, animals, education, humanitarian, social, or ethical.
