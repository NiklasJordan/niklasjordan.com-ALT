# Ahoy!

<p class="lead">I am Niklas, a problem solver for Nonprofits with passion for good user experience and technology.</p>

I help *good* organizations <mark>create products and services people need (and love) that have a good impact on their mission and the world</mark>. I do this through smart research, experience and psychology.
I live in Schwerin, in the Northern Germany. It’s pretty nice here, I think you’d like it.

Check out the [services I offer](/who-i-am.html) to learn how I can help you to do good better.

**I'm in it for good:** My focus is on delivering projects for organisations or companies that do good stuff. Green, animals, education, humanitarian, social or ethical.
